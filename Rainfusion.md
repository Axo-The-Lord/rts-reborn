**RTS Reborn** Is an *in-progress* expansion mod for Risk of Rain that aims to backport content from its sequel, *Risk of Rain 2*. Almost every aspect of the game is overhauled, including tons of new items, monsters, stages, and characters (eventually)!

NOTE: This is a recreation of the original mod *Risk of Rain 2: Return to Sender* which was made by N4K0 and Sivelos. Their original mod is now deprecated, and development will continue here.

# ITEMS

The beloved items from Risk of Rain 2 return! RTS Reborn currently adds **19 Items** to the base game, including the brand-new **Lunar Item tier**, adding a new level of risk and reward to your runs. Pick them up from **Lunar Pods** or the **Bazaar Between Time**! This mod currently adds:

- 3 **Common** Items
- 4 **Uncommon** Items
- 2 **Rare** Items
- 3 **Use** Items
- And 6 **Lunar** Items!

---

# OBJECTS

From **Combat Shrines** to **Category Chests**, this mod adds a wide variety of **Map Objects** to populate your world and spice up your gameplay. They are:

- **Lunar Buds:** Pay one Lunar Coin for a random Lunar Item!
- **Category Chests:** A slightly more expensive chest that will give you more specific items!
- **Shrine of Combat:** This shrine will spawn some monsters that yield extra rewards!
- **Newt Altars:** These strange shrines are hidden across the Planet, praying to one may bring you to a hidden realm...

---

# SURVIVORS

Currently, RTS Reborn adds **1 new survivor**, but more will be coming soon!
- Completely rewritten from the ground up, the **Artificer** is better than ever with a reskin designed by Glasus and her newfound ability to *aim attacks while hovering*! She has large AOE capabilities, as well as being able to both *ignite* and *execute* her foes.

---

# STAGES

RTS Reborn plans to add many new environments to the Planet. However, the only currently accessible stage is the **Bazaar Between Time**. Buy and Barter with the mysterious Newt, a new shopkeeper who sells Lunar Items!

# FOR MODDERS

This mod is compatible with (probably) all other mods on Rainfusion. And for **Starstorm** fans: Fear not! Not only is RTS Reborn fully compatible with Starstorm, it even has *additional functionality* enabled so the two work seamlessly together!

Want to make an RTS-Compatible mod or add-on? RTS comes decked out with some god-awful libraries you can use, including custom currencies, hidden realms, ability charges, and more!

# PROFILE FLAGS

RTS comes with a few profile flags so you can customize your experience:

- `rts-debug`: Outputs a whole bunch of stuff to the console. You probably won't need this unless you're a developer!
- `rts-classic-meteor`: Change the Glowing Meteorite from a Lunar Item back into a regular Use Item.
- `rts-classic-permafrost`: Remove Permafrost's execute ability.
- `rts-mute-gesture`: Gesture of the Drowned does not trigger the activation sound.

# AKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This is my first-ever Risk of Rain mod, and this mod would never be up on Rainfusion had it not been for all these amazing people.

- **Sivelos**, for making the bulk of the original mod and sprites. If it weren't for what he had left behind, I wouldn't have started this project.
- **NK**, for being the reason I still play Risk of Rain and for having the patience to guide me. The Starstorm mod is mostly what keeps RoR1 relevant these days, and the modding community would definitely be dead without it.
- **AnAwesomeDude**, who lives up to her name. Whenever I was suffering, she was eager to lend a hand. Also did some sounds at one point!
- **Jingo**, for helping me out with skill icons and other miscellaneous sprites - and for always being excited about the mod.
- **Glasus**, who is the god of pixel art and made several assets, notably the Lunar items.
- **Subwit**, for helping with some sprites, but most importantly for making the incredible Monster Log artwork. If you haven't seen them yet - you're missing out!
- **Affenstark** and **Altzeus**, for doing most of the heavy lifting in the last stretch of development. I know fixing bugs isn't fun.
- To my **Beta Testers**, who helped with bug-tracking and balancing.
- And to everyone else on the **Risk of Rain** and **Starstorm** Discord servers, who helped me when I was stuck. The amount of support I've had with this project is honestly astounding, and there's no way I would be here without you guys. <3

I thank you all immensely.

# WHAT'S NEXT?

*When is the next update??*

Whenever it's ready. I'd love to be able to release updates regularly but I have an abnormal schedule and I don't want the pressure of deadlines. In the meantime, enjoy the mod in its current state and please wait patiently for the next update! We're not sure what it's going to be yet, so we'll let the community decide what stage they'd like to see added next.

*DLC??*

Our plans are to release the *Survivors of the Void* DLC as a separate mod, dependent on RTS's libraries.
