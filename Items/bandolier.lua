-- ammo pack should have a "free" variable which dictates whether or not it is in the air, once collision check is true, set "free" to false to prevent future collision checks
-- "physics" update and collision detection only occur if the ammo pack is free

-- checking if a player is nearby can be carried out in a way where the game first checks if dy <= r

Their favorite activity was to tie up people they didn\'t like and drag them behind their horses â€“ Grundy clearly had a sweet spot for the old days.\n\nThe sling carries an impressive assortment of ammunition - Grundy himself carried many different guns.
